	<p>
		Documentation for the ujImagePicker module which provides an image picker as a custom form field for Jamroom 5.
	</p>

	<div class="page-header">
		<h1>Installation</h1>
	</div>

	<p>
		Upload the module to your server.
	</p>
	<p>
		Go to the module info tab in the admin control panel and enable it.
	</p>

		<h2>Add an image picker to a form using the Form Designer</h2>
	</div>
	<p>
		In this example we will add a field to allow the user to choose a kitten, as shown in the screenshot.
	</p>
	<img src="{$jamroom_url}/modules/ujImagePicker/screenshots/imagepicker-in-form-screenshot.jpg" alt="Screenshot of ujImagePicker being used in a form" title="Screenshot of ujImagePicker being used in a form">
	<ol>
		<li>Go to your form, then click on the Form Designer button.</li>
		<li>Add a new custom field named appropriately.</li>
		<li>In the field type dropdown select "imagepicker" or "imagepicker_multiple", check the box to allow both "create" and "update" and set the field to "active". See the screenshot below.</li>
		<li>You can add your images directly into the Options field (see the field's inline help for how to do that). For this example add the name of the test function: ujImagePicker_choose_a_kitten. To show the images with labels use ujImagePicker_choose_a_labelled_kitten. You can look at these test functions in include.php to see how to format your array of images.</li>
		<li>Click the View button to return to the profile form. You should now see the kittens to choose from.</li>
	</ol>
	<p> 
	    For both single and multiple selects your function should return an array like this:
	</p>
	<pre>
		array(
			'1'    =>    'http://placekitten.com/120/100',
			'2'    =>    'http://placekitten.com/160/100',
			'3'    =>    'http://placekitten.com/110/100',
			'4'    =>    'http://placekitten.com/130/100',
			'5'    =>    'http://placekitten.com/150/100'
		);
	</pre>
	<p> 
	    And if you need labels with the images format your array like this:
	</p>
	<pre>
		array(
			'cute'    =>    array('img_src'=>'http://placekitten.com/120/100','label'=>'cute kitten'),
			'cuter'   =>    array('img_src'=>'http://placekitten.com/160/100','label'=>'cuter kitten'),
			'cutest'  =>    array('img_src'=>'http://placekitten.com/110/100','label'=>'cutest kitten'),
			'yuck'    =>    array('img_src'=>'http://placekitten.com/130/100','label'=>'unpleasant kitten'),
			'sucker'  =>    array('img_src'=>'http://placekitten.com/150/100','label'=>'dog in disguise')
		);
	</pre>
	<p> 
	    If you have a directory of images, use this directory scanning function with the directory path from the site root:
	</p>
	<pre>
		ujImagePicker_get_images_from_dir(images/banksy/thumbs)
	</pre>
	<p> 
	    The image name (or names if using multiple select) will be saved to the db. You will want to make sure your images are of a suitable size to show in the form.
	</p>
	
	<p>If you want the select menu to show as well, make your array return this as one of the options"</p>
	<pre>'show_select'    =>    true,</pre>

	<p> 
	    And thats about all there is. Simple really.
	</p>
